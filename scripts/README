README 
	for Multi-Whole-Genome-Alignment Pipeline
	Last edited on 02/04/2020 -- GAREEVES

PIPELINE OVERVIEW
	This pipeline takes a set of genome fasta files and generates both pairwise alignment
	and multi-alignment files. The genomes are split into individual chromosomes and then
	pairwise alignments are generated in an all-by-all manner for the selected species.
	These pairwise alignments are then used to build chromosome wide chains that are 
	merged into a single, genome-wide chain and net. The pipeline then can use the final
	pairwise alignments to generate various multiple alignments: (a) generate a reference
	base, one-way multi-alignment, (b)generate a reference free, all-way multi-alignment,
	or (c) generate a reference based, all-way multi-alignment. The pipeline can also 
	clean up any intermediate files generated during the multi-alignment process.

HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS	
	The pipeline is designed to work on a cluster using SLURM for job submission and a
	86x64 ubuntu/linux architecture.

TEST CASE
	For the purpose of testing the pipeline a set of small test genomes (Exam, Test, and
	Samp) are already included in ~/WGA/1_genomes/Whole/ as well as an example formate
	file at ~/WGA/Scripts/Species_List.txt. This example case should have and approximate
	runtime of 30 minutes.
